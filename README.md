This little comb jelly needs a friend! Let's add some pages of the coolest sea creatures we can find.

#### The goal: 
In your project, add an image of a sea creature to the "images" folder. 

Stretch goal: Make a new HTML file using your first and last name titled `firstname-lastname.html`, then make an image element that uses the image you added to the "images" folder.

#### To do this:

Follow the [Lambda GitHub workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qS0FImmfZ7rIAGHnu1_7R1Z8GiCrATAXTbgfw4x8XA/edit) to fork/clone/push/etc your code.
